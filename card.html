			<p class="description">Once she is ruler of the hive, the queen bee needs to mate. She flies out of the hive to mate with 10 to 15 different drones for three days. She stores the sperms from each drone in her spermatheca. She can use this sperm to fertilize eggs for the next seven years. Each day the queen can lay up to 20,000 eggs and exceed her own body weight in eggs.</p>
